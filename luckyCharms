I can't eat rainbows,
But I can eat cereal,
Lucky Charms doesn't taste like a rainbow,
But they taste pretty damn good,
If they sue us,
Who gets the pot of gold?

I have never eaten Lucky Charms,
Nor am I a lawyer,
But because I have contributed to this poem,
I will be forked untill my hopes and dreams are over.
