No rainbows in the sky
No clouds and rains
No water till sun shine
I want to forget about all that
and i really enjoy riding on coding train
Because it is the coding train time.
Because when the train starts I cant stop
and when my dreams come true, I am gonna dance on hip hop like Mithun Da!
and do epic stuff!
I am an indian by heart
I enloy the ride of coding train :)
And coder by soul!
I love not only git but also github,
Lets go to the pub!

YES GIT HUB IS POWERFUL. I AM LEARNING IT IN 2018. ALAS, It's Too Late
